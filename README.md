# mybus.metro.net

Metro is redesigning its bus service as part of the [NextGen project](https://www.metro.net/projects/nextgen/).  Service updates will be rolled out as part of the regular bi-annual service shakeups that occur every December and June.

The first phase of changes went live on Sunday, December 13, 2020.  The [first version of this tool](https://lacmta.github.io/is-my-bus-changing/) was created as a proof of concept in preparation for that shakeup.

We are redesigning the tool based on user feedback and preparing it for a June 1 launch in preparation for the June 27, 2021 shakeup.
