# mybus.metro.net
### Updated: 11/15/2021


Metro has been redesigning its bus service as part of the [NextGen project](https://www.metro.net/projects/nextgen/).  Service updates were rolled out as part of the regular bi-annual service shakeups that occur every December and June.

Phase 1 of NextGen changes went live on Sunday, December 13, 2020.  The [first version of this tool](https://lacmta.github.io/is-my-bus-changing/) was created as a proof of concept in preparation for that shakeup.

With each successive shakeup, we iteratively redesigned and automated aspects of this tool.
